					shows the configuration of a typical disconnect switch in a substation with maximum allowable bus span. Since this is a symmetric configuration, only one structure (one side of the plane of symmetry) will be modeled. Symmetry boundary condition resisting only moments are imposed at the plane of symmetry in the model and the presence of a flexible bus between pothead and switch stands isolates the two structure mechanically
